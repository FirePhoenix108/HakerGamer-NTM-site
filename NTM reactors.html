  <h1> Welcome and hi! </h1> 
  <div>
    Hi and welcome to my site! Today i am going to tell you something about NTM reactors! 
   <br> I will start to the esiest reactor to do in survival mode in Minecraft. 
   <h1> The ZIRNOX reactor.</h1> 
   <br> The ZIRNOX reactor, is a reactor that as been added by HBM Bobcat (the creator of NTM) 
   <br> As far as i found on the internet, he created this reactor. 
   <br> The ZIRNOX reactor can use some types of fuel, but it can breed some materials to become nuclear fuel. 
   <br> Here are some examples: 
   <br> Thorium can be breeded to become Thorium fuel. If u want to do this process, use a ZIRNOX rod of natural uranium, 
   <br> a good ZIRNOX nuclear fuel! 
   <h1> The Research Reactor.</h1> 
   <br> Did you saw some videos on YouTube where they power up some nuclear reactor? 
   <br> You probably saw one of this reactors. 
   <br> In this mod you can use this reactor with the Breeding Reactor. 
   <br> Maybe i will say something about this item in this mod, but what i can say is that this item 
   <br> have 1 utility... Breed nuclear rods. 
   <br> Let's get again to the Research Reactor now! 
   <br> Let's talk now about the fuel it use. 
   <br> Fuel plates! 
   <br> You can use some radioactive materials like <b>Uranium-233</b> or <b>Plutonium-239</b>. 
   <br> There are other materials but i will explaine them in another page! 
   <br> For start the reactor you don't need something that is hard to get! 
   <br> You will only need a <b> neutron source </b> for start the reactor, like <b>Ra226</b> (Radium). 
   <br> With this reactor, you can work with it even when you are not in with it, with the Remote Reactor Control Block. 
   <h1> The RBMK reactor.</h1> 
   <br> Ok now, you may know this reactor type because of a storical event that happend in the 1986. 
   <br> What they used in that power plant was a RBMK-1000. 
   <br> What we use here is our personal reactor! 
   <br> There are a lot of items dedicated for this reactor like all the columns we need for the construction of the RBMK.
